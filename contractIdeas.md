Unanimously Communicate amongst ourselves (non-verbal)

Integrated communication: speaking and listening to everyone

Allowing there to be difference without letting the difference become a source of conflict

Perfect Classroom:
- respect diff. visions and ideas
- dialogue
- respeciting each others:
    - time (arrive on time; trying to give people equivalent time to talk)

/////////////////////

everyone needs to participate
    - engaged?
    - speak up?

Justify why something does or doesn't work
    - how can we help each other understand what the symbolism and audience are and then how those work to gether to define "goodness" or "badness" of a work.
    - cleary stated prompts and assignments

Meet in small groups frequently to better work through ideas
    - 2 groups of 4, 2 groups of 3, 
    - 1 group of 2 + KB, 4 groups of 3
    - (theses were from when there were 14 students enrolled)

//////////////////////////////

## In class "rules"
don't talk over others, instead wait for everyone to express ideas/opinions then respectfully answer

a general share of climate change articles; art, etc. @  beginning or end of each class?

## class structure?
a good classroom fosters discussion, and feels casual. I like when there are small tables so that smaller discussions are possible. but also allows for walking to different tables for different ways of thinking. Sometimes where there is one large table OR all individual desks there is a tendency NOT to talk. lisen to lectures or presentations and then discuss amongst the table. small dry erase boards; ask a question and work/answer as a group? 

## General Resources
there will be so many big topics in terms of scale, impact, concept, addtiontioall ywe are all coming from differnt backgrounds it would be interesting to have a runnin document/spreadsheet to list our inspirations research materials etc.

## Critique?
not sure how crit/project sharing will o. but if we do weekly checkins to help with maintaining progress that would be ideal. perhaps at each in progress checkin we talk about how readings or things people have discovered show up in works? how its informed the making? how it informs out practice? And it could go the other way -- the works we are making might inform class directions find readings, etc. to support new directions we take our selves?

/////////////////////////////////////

Respect Above All.
- people
- time
- space
- etc.

Acknowledge your priveledge, be open to learning from other's experiences, inclduing those who don't have a seat at the table.

Judgement and discrimination free learnin environment.

/////////////////////////////////

Space for talking.
- Small Groups then come togeter?
    - designate a speaker for the group?
- crit:
    - how to join many disciplines?
    - how to join many crit styles?
- How to let people know they are not letting others share/participate?

how to deal with conflicting opinions?

A good classroom is a talkative one.

Account for different levels of participation
    - small vs. large groups?
    - interactive where possible
    - written ways of critiquing?
    - how else?
    - running document/blog of knowledge surrounding climate change stuff?

//////////////////////////////

What are good ways of setting up the room for conversation and presentation success? freedom to rearrange as needed.
