# Climate Change and Sustainabilit for Artists and Designers

- Fall 2019
- Wednesdays 0i830-1400

This studio course focuses on cimate change as a social justice issue; the material ecologies of our practices; and the interconnection of all things. The projects/output created over the term will be driven through exporation of information you encounter in this course (the questions you ask; the "answers" you find (an answer could be more questions)) via the mediums of your choosing.

Our climate is rapidly changing due to the effects of human industry. Climate change is presenting the global society with the necessity for new criteria of industrial and social production. How will this include the production of art and design? The goal of this course is to present students with the challendge to examine, investigate, confront, and potentially apply what these critera are. This class focuses on the theoretical, practical, and aesethetic issues of sustainability. Beginning wit an overview of the history of the science of climate change, students look at global movements responding to this event. Students who are considering entering some aspect of this field are welcome as well as those who are seeking to extend their art practice to address the many issues encountered in the massive change towards sustainability.

## Wk1.
- Syllabus / Class Contract
  - What are my criteria?
    - Did you ask/generate questions?
    - Did you make/generate outcomes?
    - MICA's attendance policy
    - You either do all of these things; and receive an A, or do not, and receive an F â€¦ all other "grading" will be through dicussion related to work and conversations with me at midterm.
  - What are the students?
    - individually write up ideas, then in groups of 2, then in groups of 4, then everyone?
- how is this class about climate, energy, food, social justice, sustainability? (or rather how can all those things be framed as social justice issues; and how is _sustainability_ a recipe for doing something about them from a new, more equal context?)
- Introduce the Cumulus2020 pitch too?
- What is Climate Change?
  - what can an individual do?
- Introduce projects? Introduce overall term plan... First project: answer my questions; bring in your answers and any other questions you have next week...
  - Project 1: Behavior Change
- I Heart Huckabees
- Homework: 
  - pick the behavior you want to change /  - Project 1: Behavior Change
  - questions from _Teaching as subversive activity?_
  - read: 

## Wk2. 
- What is Sustainability?
- What questions should students investigate?
- Discuss answers to questions from last week
- What behavior will you change?
  - and how to document that?
- P2: What do you want to sustain. Sustainability requires that first you define what it is you will be sustaining. In the fight against climate change what do you think is important to sustain??? Define that for yourself. We'll then spend the following 4 weeks working on a piece that visualizes or helps to explain your answer.
- Homework:
  - work on your behavior changing
  - figure out what your definition of sustainbility is and how you might begin to visualize that.
  - Listen: Timothy Morton Anthropocene talk on Internet Archive

## Wk3.
- What is entropy?
- If everything is connected, then why is shit so fucked up?
- What are we going to do? (overview of solutions/ideas???)
- How is entropy connected w/ carbon cycle? how is spaceship earth a closed system? how does that affect our understanding of our practices?
- What else can we think about look at?
- green peace; extinction rebellion; (started a list in my office) make a long list of different groups; radical or otherwise. (I can go back and check in my _American environmentatlism_ book? -- but what about other orgs from other countries; asian? African? let us expand this list of doers) -- hugh has a pretty extensive list on the old edublog site too.

## Wk4.
- what is a material ecology? (what is your material ecology? what ecology does your practice function in/create?)
- Where do your materials come from
- what are alternate materials or practices?

- Appropriate technologies? Appropriate art? Appropriate practice?
- Sue Spaid? help here someplace?
- Rope in Graham for something?
- What about the office of sustainability?
- Where to fit in the Cumulus 2020 stuff?
- what is the carbon cycle? (how does the carbon cycle work???)
- which artists are tackling this already in their work?
- who else can we look to for help? information? advice? "solutions"? (where else?)
- What is to be questioned/answered for next week? What is something you can do that reduces CO2 output; takes CO2 out of the air; puts CO2 into the ground? Is there something that can be turned into a project for the city?
- Introduce the behavior change project that will run over the rest of the term. Think about your answers from last week and what we've talked about this week to help you pick a behavior/action/etc. to modify.
- Listen: ecosocialism part 1
- Listen: ecosocialism part 2

Should I just do this as a 15 week massive change style project (mini massive change/ mini change?). Basically we would work all term towards an exhibition about revealing what is hidden regarding CO2 emissions or something like that? Different ways we can really do something right now -- AND HAVE TO START DOING THINGS RIGHT NOW! Where can we hold an exhibition? does it need to be off campus? what about someplace like Union? What about the inner harbor? The aquarium? the Science Musuem?
