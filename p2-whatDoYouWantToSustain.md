# What do you want to sustain?

Be clear about what you want "sustainability" to mean in your contexts. Make a work that helps visualize or communicate this idea to an audience. The medium and audience are up to you.

A major issue of "Sustainability" is that there are many different and conflicting definitions. Sustainability means nothing without declaring what it is you want to sustain. Think about the world you want to inhabit in the future; what is needed to get us there? What values do you hold dear that you think we all should? What aspects of culture or economy or whatever else do you hope to exist in our collective future? Pick what you want to sustain -- the Flourishing of all life? human happiness? whatever it is -- and work to visualize that in a medium of your choice.

Help a viewer understand or internalize your personal view of sustainability. How can we connect each other with the ideas/ideals of sustainability more personally. It is an opportunity to see the complications in universally agreeing on something so ethereal as a single "sustainability" meaning ... and how symbolic gesture can visualize a more clear understanding for us all.
