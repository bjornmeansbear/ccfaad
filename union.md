Walking/Bike Path

This runs along the jones falls. Can this act as 1. a people connector; and 2. a water management feature.

- permeable pavers: provides solid walking/road biking foundation, but still allows for water to soak through stones? (shit, does this then need mowin?)
- how can swales be added to a) direct water into good spots; b) act as extra "levee" for really high water
- native plants
- build carbon sequestration and water holding capacity
- are there some water storage features that could also be created?
- how can the whole thing act as water slowing feature for big rains and such?
- what sort of wildlife habitat is created? can we think about how to provide homes for birds, rabbits, frogs, insects, owls, bats, whatever in the rejuvination of the area? 
- how does it tie into a large idea for the whole area? how about impetus for rejuvinating fallsway itself???
- is there anything edible that can be planted? apple trees or sometihng?
- what sorts of deep rooting grasses would be good there?
- how about water purifying plants? like a wetland "shelf" at the top of the concrete that the design helps funnel waters through?
- are there any issues of shade in the area? does the interstate shade it too much of the day for some potential ideas?
- what other features of informational usefullness could be there: how is the path a substrate to put signs upon; how can it inform, pass useful information on, to users of the path?
- partnerships with blue water baltimore? waterfront partnership?
- graham maybe has some ideas?

sidenote: how about the ccfaad class does a big exhibition at the brewery in November/December? sort of a mini "Green Acres" or similar sue spaid style "EcoVention" show??? student works; maybe some curated other works?

- friends of the jone's falls???
- can we cut the fence down and just connect this stuff together.
- Bikemore (what DOT guy has overlap) should I connect more with them too?

It is really wide! Oh! use the apple measure app to get a rough idea?

So, what to do with the old asphalt? can it be used to create a sort of "terrace"? is it safe to do that to help control, slow the water and collect "pools" to have mini-wetlands all over the place?
