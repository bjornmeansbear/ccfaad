# Behavior Change.

Based on your understanding of Climate Change & Sustainability so far, pick a behavior in your life that you'd like to change for the better. This should be something that would be really hard to do. Somethign that if you were going to change for good, you might not do it, but that you can carry on with for the duration of our semester. Maybe it is not using electricity in your apartment at night; maybe it is picking up all the trash you see; maybe it is only walking or biking everywhere; maybe it is trying a zero waste lifestyle; maybe it is sorting the trash and recycling correctly in your classrooms at the end of class; maybe it is becoming a way more serious activist for climate issues ... Whatever you choose, also document how you make the change; and what else changes. Do this for the next 14 weeks. The final week(s) we'll present on these changes. Make a presentation or performance or artwork (etc.) that

- documents what you did;
- helps others understand the impact;
- reveals the complications and interrelations between one choice/action and all our other choices and actions ...

Your change can evolve over the term as you attempt to "be the change" you want to see in the world -- you might realize that its too hard; too impossible; whatever, and have to negotiate with yourself to find something still extreme but more doable. Do not wholesale change/abandon your original choice (unless it is proving to be dangerous or unhealthy).
