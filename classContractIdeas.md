# A Classroom Contract?

Focus on Goals. Make expectations/explanations simple. Separate into different kinds of rules and expectations...

What are the values, rules, & consequences in our class meetings

What is non-negotiable? (in my case it is MICA's attendance policies; what from our created list should be non-negotiable?)

## My base criteria for Grading.

1. Did you ask questions?
2. Did you make outcomes?
3. Did you attend class in accordance with MICA's attendance policies.

## Your Criteria

1. What are the unacceptable behaviors?
2. What difficulties do you normally face in a classroom?
3. What are your "rights" (I have the right to express my opinion, etc.)
4. How do we enforce? (maybe better phrased as how do we hold each other accountable)?
5. What does a "good" classroom look like? sound like? feel like?
6. What does a critical classroom look, sound, and feel like?
7. How do you want me to treat you?
8. How do you want to treat on another?
9. How do you think I want to be treated by all of you?
10. How should we treat each other when there is a conflict?
11. What do your answers look like -- can you explain them clearly? (like if your answer to how we should treat each other is "act nice", what does acting nice really mean???)?
